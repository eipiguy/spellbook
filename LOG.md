I need to stop being so ambitious so fast. It's making it to where I'm designing things without having the mechanisms to make them function. I suppose that's the joy of dreaming though: not having to worry about the how or the why.

Anyway, I'm trying to write magic, and that very concerned with the how.

So to start, I have an interface to a working chat model and it now has memory. It's not great, or smart, but it works. Now I need to connect the embeddings I worked out as well.

### Organizing

I'm going through and cleaning up the interface, and I think I may have been wrong. Ambition and good planning with diagrams isn't a bad thing. I know what next steps are, but when I wanted to know where I was going in a larger context, I had to look back at the README, and then the diagram didn't seem so convoluted. It was quite helpful actually in fleshing out pseudocode.

### Connecting Data

I've got a Q/A memory in the chat. I need to include reference material. It comes out in just paragraph chunks.
